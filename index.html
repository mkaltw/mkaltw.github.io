			The Internet can be a beautiful place. A decentralized web offers
			the diversity our modern society tries to embrace, yet major tech
			corporations dominate our communications. The centralized platforms
			they operate can offer a lot but they are also dangerous. They can
			easily be used to monitor our behaviour and censor free speech. I
			believe this is not how the web -- and our society -- should work.

		<h2>Cryptocurrencies</h2>

		<p>
			This is a <i>hot</i> topic. And to be frank I have not made up my mind about this entire 'technology' yet. Actually, this is probably the wrong way to look at this anyways: As of writing this text there are more than 8.400 coins listed on <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/">coingecko.com</a>. Is every single project run by people who want to scam you out of your money? Probably not. Does every single project offer something unique, innovative and make the world a better place? Probably not.
		</p>

		<p>
			While some people promise more and more use cases for the blockchain others complain about <a href="https://www.stephendiehl.com/blog/non-innovation.html">The Non-Innovation of Cryptocurrency</a>.
			As always in life there is no black-and-white answer: I honestly believe many people in the industry try to make the world a better place. But there are also many individuals simply trying to gain financial benefit (even by ripping people off.) The fact that there is an entire market evaluated at billions of US-dollars for tokens that actually do not help you much in "the real world" is just odd. There are people calling this a <a href="https://www.stephendiehl.com/blog/ponzi.html">Postmodern Ponzi</a> - and I cannot blame them. Unfortunately, topics closely related to money always tend to be emotionally charged and discussing them rationally for the sake of argument is hard for a lot of us. <a href="https://lexfridman.com/podcast/">Lex Fridman</a> has a great series of interviews with personalities from the crypto industry. I find them very enlightening.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Leaving aside the emotions behind savings and investment I think this 'technology' (it's more of a combination of different disciplines in economics and computer science) has some very promising aspects.
			And I honestly believe a decentralized financial system offers great benefits for our society.
			But you cannot overlook the fact that Proof of Work (and Bitcoin particularly) is a catastrophe for our planet and the entire industry around cryptocurrency is still very young and not regulated.
			Thinking about it, doesn't the fascination that people have with crypto compared to the little use it offers in the 'real world' today reveal some deep flaws in our society / financial system? I don't know, maybe we are all just trying to strike it rich and everything else is secondary.

					>Please don't gamble or put your life savings into it. Do

		</p>

		<p>
			There are many ways you can educate yourself about crypto for free. I've mentioned Lex's <a href="https://lexfridman.com/podcast/">podcast</a> already. He explores many different topics aside cryptocurrency.
			Go and learn about some very stunning projects and the people who
			build these technologies. Never stop questioning incentives and ask yourself about the economics behind a project (Where can <u>promised</u> gains of <strong>10+%</strong> APY come from? How is this sustainable?).
			In this regard crypto is no different from every other investment decision.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Once again: <strong>Never stop questioning incentives!</strong> That's actually a decent mantra for all things in life.
